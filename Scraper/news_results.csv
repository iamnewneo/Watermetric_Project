The Delhi Jal Board’s plan to clean the Yamuna is yet to find any takers. Funding remains a problem for the first-of-its-kind comprehensive strategy for sprucing up the highly polluted river. Officials in charge of the project say the initiative will help restore the ecological value of the Yamuna and attract visitors to the riverfront. “Involving several agencies, this project is expected to take about two years and cost over Rs 6,000 crore. However, we are yet to receive any green signal in terms of funding commitment. We are in the process of creating a detailed plan,” said a Delhi government official who did not want to be named.In May, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra led a delegation of officers from the DJB to present this plan to union water minister Uma Bharti. However, there has been not much progress in terms of funding, the official said.“The Yamuna enters Delhi near Palla and traverses a distance of about 48km. The 22-km stretch from Wazirabad to Okhla is only 2% of the river’s length, but 70% of the total pollution gets loaded here. Around 22 drains flow directly into the river. Of these, four main drains- Najafgarh, Najafgarh supplementary, Shahdara and Barapullah, are the key contributors to pollution. The plan will address the cleaning of these as well as include individual plans for the 18 smaller drains,” a Delhi Jal Board official said.Despite decades of planning and investment to clean up the river, the Yamuna, over the years, has become more polluted. The National Green Tribunal (NGT), as part of its January 13 order, asked the various stakeholders to implement the Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017 to clean up the river.At present, as part of Yamuna Action Plan III, an initiative under the centre’s ‘Namami Gange’ programme, the rehabilitation and modernisation of STPs of a total of 814 MLD capacity at Okhla, Kondli and Rithala and the construction of a new 136-MLD capacity sewage treatment plant at Okhla are already under way. Rehabilitation of sewer lines and rising mains in the catchments of Kondli and Rithala STPs and public outreach activities are also being planned.

"The Delhi government has come up with a new “comprehensive turnaround plan for the Yamuna” to ensure that untreated water does not enter the river. The plan will be executed over the next two-and-a-half years and will cost Rs 6,000 crore, said officials.The plan will include cleaning the river, developing the river bank as a biodiversity zone, treating drain water and using spaces on the banks of drains as public spaces, said government sources.The new plan comes at a time when there is growing pressure on the government from the National Green Tribunal to clean the river. “There have been three Yamuna action plans costing crores. Other plans relating to sewage treatment were proposed. All these plans were in isolation and Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 crore was allocated and spent on various projects,” said a senior government official.The new plan has been developed by a team of Delhi Jal Board officials, headed by Water Minister Kapil Mishra, in the last six months. “This plan combines all earlier plans — point sources, non-point sources, biodiversity, ecology, river cleaning. No aspect has been left untouched and this is a detailed plan. We have mapped out each drain and how to clean them up,” said a government official.The official added, “The plan includes removing silt which gets accumulated near the river. Other projects will look at river flow and river-front development… An ecological riverfront will also be developed across 9,000 hectares. This is being done for the first time in the world on such a large scale.”Instead of just cleaning the river, the plan aims to build the area around the river and drains.“The river and all drains are being seen as one system. We are not looking at the Yamuna in isolation. We are not only cleaning the river and drains but are also developing an ecology an economy around it,” said the official.“On both sides of the large drains, for 250m, water-oriented development will take place. We will be creating a clean water body and public space. This will lead to an automatic rise in the value of land around these drains. The idea is to notify 250m around it as commercial space. We are looking at drains in two ways — as sewage or interceptors and as a wetland. Cycle tracks, greenways and paths will be developed for public utilisation along the drains,” added the official.
